## 🤖 What Makes a Survey Platform “AI-Enhanced”?

AI-driven survey tools go beyond static question lists and manual analysis. They can:

- **Generate question sets** based on objectives or topics
- **Predict user fatigue** and auto-optimize survey length
- **Summarize responses in real time**
- **Suggest follow-up questions** based on early trends
- **Segment audiences** automatically based on behavior or demographics

Think of AI in surveys as a co-pilot — helping you create better forms faster and turn raw feedback into usable insights.
