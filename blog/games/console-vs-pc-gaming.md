## üéØ Final Thoughts

There‚Äôs no universal ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ‚Äî only what fits *you*. Consoles are reliable, curated, and social. PCs are powerful, open-ended, and endlessly expandable. The line between the two is narrowing as cross-play and cloud gaming evolve.

If you want simplicity and exclusives, go console.  
If you want control and capability, go PC.

Or better yet ‚Äî do both.
