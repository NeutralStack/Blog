# Incremental Games vs Idle Games: What's the Difference?

Incremental and idle games have captured the attention of gamers with their low-maintenance gameplay and deeply satisfying progression systems. While they often get lumped together, these two genres have subtle yet significant differences that impact how they are played and enjoyed. In this post, we’ll break down the key distinctions, provide examples, and explore their evolving overlap.

## 📈 What Are Incremental Games?

Incremental games, also known as clicker games, are all about building up numbers—currency, power, production—usually by starting small and gradually automating and scaling up. Players often begin by manually clicking or interacting and unlock mechanics that incrementally increase their resources.

### 🔹 Examples of Incremental Games
- **Clicker Heroes** – A classic clicker RPG where players defeat monsters and upgrade heroes through continuous clicking and investing.
- **Auto Clicker Steam by Playsaurus** – A tool that automates clicking for incremental games, making progress faster and more seamless.
- **Cookie Clicker** – The quintessential incremental game, starting with a single cookie and growing into a global cookie empire.

## 💤 What Are Idle Games?

Idle games allow players to make progress with minimal input. They often reward time away from the game, encouraging players to return and collect accumulated resources. This genre is perfect for multitaskers or casual players who enjoy checking in rather than staying engaged constantly.

### 🔹 Examples of Idle Games
- **Mr. Mine Idle** – A mining sim that continues digging and collecting even when offline, offering deep upgrade systems and exploration.
- **Idle Miner Tycoon** – Manage a mining business and automate workflows to earn profits while you're away.
- **Clicker Games** – Many clicker platforms, like ClickerGames.io, mix idle and active mechanics for broader appeal.

## 🔁 Overlap and Hybridization

In modern game design, the lines between incremental and idle games are blurring. Many titles blend clicking mechanics with idle systems, offering a dual experience. For example, **Clicker Heroes** starts as a clicking game but eventually shifts into a heavily idle experience. Similarly, **Auto Clicker** tools empower users to bridge the gap by turning manual tasks into idle experiences.

## 📊 When to Choose Which?

- **Incremental Games**: Ideal if you enjoy active engagement, strategy, and seeing immediate impact from your choices.
- **Idle Games**: Perfect for passive playstyles, allowing background progress and minimal interaction.
