## üåå Setting and Lore

**Genshin Impact** drops players into the open-world fantasy continent of **Teyvat**, composed of diverse regions each inspired by real-world cultures. It‚Äôs a blend of elemental magic, ancient mysteries, and gods vying for control, woven through a character-driven narrative.

**Honkai: Star Rail** on the other hand, takes a sci-fi approach, placing players aboard the **Astral Express** as they journey across various planets.

- **Honkai: Star Rail**: Turn-based combat focused on strategy and synergy within a 4-character team. Streamlined progression with less reliance on physical movement or platforming.

While Genshin allows for more hands-on exploration and puzzle-solving, Star Rail‚Äôs combat is deeper in tactical decision-making.
